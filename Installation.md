Python for Astronomers
======================

Prelude
-------

If you use Windows, please come talk to one of us (Daniel, office 1.01 or JoÃ£o office 1.03) before the first practical class.


Installation check
------------------

If you use Mac or Linux it's probable that Python is already installed in your system.
To test this, open a terminal and type

    $ python
    Python 2.7.8 |Anaconda 2.1.0 (32-bit)| (default, Aug 21 2014, 18:22:40) 
    [GCC 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-1)] on linux2
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>>

you should see similar output to the above. If you don't, go to [(0)](#install-python).

Check Python's version number; it should be higher than 2.7.0. 
If your version is 3.x.x tell us before the practical class.

(Note: to exit the Python interpreter press Ctrl-D)


To check if you have IPython installed just type 

    $ ipython
    Python 2.7.8 |Anaconda 2.1.0 (32-bit)| (default, Aug 21 2014, 18:22:40) 
    Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

    IPython 2.2.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python.
    Anaconda is brought to you by Continuum Analytics.
    Please check out: http://continuum.io/thanks and https://binstar.org
    ?         -> Introduction and overview of IPython's features.
    %quickref -> Quick reference.
    help      -> Python's own help system.
    object?   -> Details about 'object', use 'object??' for extra details.
    
    In [1]: 

If you see similar output, all is fine. 
If you don't, go to [(2)](#install-ipython).

(Note: press Ctrl-D or type `exit` to get out of the IPython interpreter)


To check for numpy, matplotlib and scipy (the packages we will need for the practical classes) type the following

    $ python -c "import numpy"
    $ python -c "import matplotlib"
    $ python -c "import scipy"
    
if you see errors like this

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
    ImportError: No module named numpy
    
from any of the above commands, go to [(3)](#install-packages). 
If there is no output from the commands, everything is fine.

(0) Installing Python
-----------------

The preferred way to install Python is to use the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io/anaconda-overview).
This will work for Mac, Windows and Linux. 
Point your browser [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and download the appropriate installer for your system.
Please **download Python version 2.7**.


(1) Installing `pip`
-------------------

`pip` comes pre-installed with Anaconda!

To test the installation type `pip -V` and it should output the version as well the Python version.


<a name="install-ipython"/>
(2) Installing IPython
------------------

`IPython` comes pre-installed with Anaconda!

To test the installation type `ipython -v` and it should output the version.
Also check that the output of `which ipython` contains the anaconda folder, like in `/home/USER/anaconda/bin/ipython`. 



Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy and Astropy also come pre-installed with Anaconda
